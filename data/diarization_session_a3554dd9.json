It defines the functions of a coffee machine like making a coffee, making a cappuccino, Allah te etc. Now, when you buy a real coffee machine, it's like an object, right? It just buy it and place on a table like an object. Now, let's come to the OOPs part of it. So the OOPs has four different pillars. The first one is encapsulation. Now, what is the capsule? It's the capsule, right? What is the capsule? It has some medicine inside and it's hidden by the outer capsule.", "start": 10.28, "end": 36.28, "duration": 26.0, "needs_improvement": false, "improvement": {"reason": "Error: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

It's all hidden under the outer casing. Now, this is encapsulation like bundling of data and hiding under a casing. Now moving on to the next one, it is abstraction.

I don't care about the steps to make an espresso like that is handled by the machine. So, it is, the machine is abstracting the function to make an espresso and simply giving me a button. That is abstraction. Moving on to the next one, it's inheritance. Now, inheritance is really simple. It's like you inherit your father's property, right? Now, in terms of the coffee machine, like suppose you have a smaller coffee machine and then your budget increases and you buy a premium one. Now, suppose the smaller one only makes espresso and heats up water. And the premium one, it makes tapu chino, it makes elate and also makes, it definitely makes an espresso and heats up water, right? So, it is inheriting the properties of the base one and also addigates own properties. Now, think in terms of cars, you have a base version and then you have a higher end model. Now, obviously the higher end model has all the features of the base one plus the extra features, right? Now, moving on to the last one with this polymorphism.", "start": 54.56, "end": 112.48, "duration": 57.92, "needs_improvement": false, "improvement": {"reason": "Error: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

Now, suppose I have two coffee machines, one of brand X and one of brand Y. Now, and I have a same button, brew on both of them. Now, when I press the brew button on the brand X, it makes an espresso. When I press the same button on brand Y, it makes a filter coffee. Now, the same function or the same button performs multiple function and it appears in multiple forms that is polymorphism. That's right time guys. I have my vaccine everything well.
