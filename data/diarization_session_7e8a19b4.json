Object-oriented programming. We will take a real simple example of a coffee machine and we will see. So think of the coffee machine as a class. It is like a blueprint. It defines the functions of a coffee machine like making a coffee, making a cappuccino, allate, etc. Now when you buy a real coffee machine, it is like an object, right? It is by it and placed on a table, like an object. Now let's come to the OOPs part of it. So the OOPs has four different pillars. The first one is encapsulation.", "start": 0.0, "end": 30.64, "duration": 30.64, "needs_improvement": false, "improvement": {"reason": "", "suggestion": ""}}, {"text": "Now what is the capsule? It is the capsule, right? What is the capsule? It has some medicine inside and it is hidden by the outer capsule. Now in terms of the coffee machine, a coffee machine has some internal wiring, it has a heating element, it has a coffee grinder, it is all hidden under the outer casing. Now this is encapsulation like bundling of data and hiding under the casing. Now moving on to the next one, it is abstraction. Now it may seem like a big term but it really isn't. Now suppose I want an espresso. Now how do you say to the machine like I just press a button off, I press one and it gives me an espresso. I don't care about the steps to make an espresso like that is handled by the machine. So it is the machine is abstracting the function to make an espresso and simply giving me a button. That is abstraction.", "start": 30.64, "end": 71.92, "duration": 41.28, "needs_improvement": true, "improvement": {"reason": "The explanation of encapsulation is incomplete; it only mentions hiding data, not the bundling of data and methods together, which is a core aspect in OOP.", "suggestion": "Now, what is encapsulation? Think of a medicine capsule: it holds medicine inside, hidden by the outer shell. In programming, like our coffee machine, encapsulation means bundling the data (like water level, coffee beans) and the methods (like `makeEspresso`, `heatWater`) that operate on that data into a single unit, and hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world. This protects the data and ensures it's manipulated only through defined methods. Moving on to abstraction..."}}, {"text": "Moving on to the next one, it is inheritance. Now inheritance is really simple. It is like you inherit your father's property, right? Now in terms of the coffee machine, like suppose you have a smaller coffee machine and then your budget increases and you buy a premium one. Now suppose the smaller one only makes espresso and heats up water. And the premium one, it makes tapu-cinum, it makes elate and it also makes definitely makes an espresso and heats up water, right?", "start": 72.47999999999999, "end": 96.64, "duration": 24.16, "needs_improvement": false, "improvement": {"reason": "", "suggestion": ""}}, {"text": "So it is inheriting the properties of the base one and also addigates own properties. Now think in terms of cars, you have a base version and then you have a higher end model. Now obviously the higher end model has all the features of the base one plus some extra features, right? Now moving on to the last one with this polymorphism. Now it seems like a complex term, but it is really simple, what it simply means is many forms or multiple forms. Now suppose I have two coffee machines, one of brand X and one of brand Y. Now and I have a same button, brew on both of them. Now when I press the brew button on the brand X, it makes an espresso. When I press the same button on brand Y, it makes a filter coffee. Now the same function, the same button performs multiple function, it appears in multiple forms that is polymorphism. That's right time guys, I have been everything well. Thank you so much.", "start": 96.64, "end": 147.52, "duration": 50.88, "needs_improvement": false, "improvement": {"reason": "", "suggestion": ""}}]}
