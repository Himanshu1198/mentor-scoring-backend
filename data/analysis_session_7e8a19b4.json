So today we will be learning about Yes, Oops. Object oriented programming. Will take a real simple example of a coffee machine and we will see. So think of the coffee machine as a class. It's like a blueprint. It defines the functions of a coffee machine. Like making a coffee. Making a capuccino, a latte, etc. Now when you buy a real coffee machine, It's like an object, right? It's just bite and place a table. Like an object. Now let's come to the Oops part of it. So Oops has four different pillars. First one is encapsulation. Now what is encapsulation? What is encapsulation? It has a medicine inside. And it's hidden by the outer capsules. Now in terms of the coffee machine, a coffee machine has some internal wiring. It has a heating element. It has a coffee grinder. It's all hidden under the outer casing. Now this is encapsulation. Bundling of data and hiding under casing. Now moving onto the next one, it is abstraction. Now it may seem like a brick term, but it really isn't. Now suppose I want to express so. Now how do you see them? To the machine, like I just press a button of express. So I ended it gives me an express. I don't care about this steps to make an express. Right? That is handled by the machine. So it is the machine is abstracting. The function to make an express simply giving me a button. That is abstraction. Moving on to the next one, inheritance. Now, inheritance is really simple. It's like you inherit your father's property. Right? Now in terms of the coffee machine, In like suppose you have a smaller coffee machine. And then your budget increases and you buy a premium one. Now suppose a smaller one only makes express so and hits a quarter. And the premium one, it makes tapuccino. It makes a latte. And also makes it definitely makes an express so and hits a quarter. Right? So it is inheriting the properties of the base one and also Add it gets own properties. Now think in terms of cars, you have a base version and then you have a higher end model. Now obviously the higher end model has all the features of the base one, plus the mixture features, right? Now moving onto the last one, which is more and more physical. Now it seems like a complex term, but it's really simple. What it simply means is many forms or multiple forms. Now suppose I have two coffee machines, one of brand X and one of brand Y. Now I have a same button, brew on both of them. Now when I press the brew button on the brand X, it makes an express so. When I press the same button on brand Y, it makes a filter coffee. Now the same function, the same button, performs multiple function. It appears in multiple forms. That is polymorphism. That's right, I have my X-Wave everything fell.
